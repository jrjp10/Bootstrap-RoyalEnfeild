        <p class="text-muted">
          The British roots of Royal Enfield got an Indian soul in 1955, when
          Madras Motors started manufacturing the motorcycles in Chennai. Six
          decades later, it has led the leisure motorcycling culture in India
          from the front. The iconic motorcycles have been accomplices to a
          thousand adventures and the dependable steed of the men in uniform.
          The upbeat response to the latest models is testimony to the fact that
          motorcycles are still trusted, loved and rode upon.
